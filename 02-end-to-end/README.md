Build a platform for online coding interviews using React + Vite.

The app should be able to do the following:

1. Create a link and share it with candidates
2. Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
3. Show real-time updates to all connected users
4. Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
5. Execute code safely in the browser

Make sure that all the logic is covered with tests.
Don't implement backend, so everything is mocked. But centralize all the calls to the backend in one place

* Implement later on project UI
Add real backend: Connect to Supabase for persistent sessions and real WebSocket sync
Enhance editor: Add cursor positions, participant colors, code snippets library
Prompting/Visual edits: Customize colors, add company branding, tweak layouts
